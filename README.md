# Shopping-cart-with-localStorage

Project to test the localStorage in a shopping cart

If you open the index.html you will see several courses to add to the cart, if they are added they will be stored in the local storage,
so if the user reloads the page or exits and re-enters later, the courses will still appear in the cart shopping
